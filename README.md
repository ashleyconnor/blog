I keep forgetting a lot of these commands which is why this file exists.

*  draft      # Creates a new draft post with the given NAME
*  post       # Creates a new post with the given NAME
*  publish    # Moves a draft into the _posts directory and sets the date
*  unpublish  # Moves a post back into the _drafts directory
*  page       # Creates a new page with the given NAME

Other commands:
* `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` - Serve with drafts
