title: How to approach LeetCode problems.
---
When approaching a new LeetCode problem I like to take the following steps:

1. Carefully read the question at least twice.
2. Take notes of any: limits, important details, restrictions and requirements.
3. Use the example to come up with other edge cases that need to be tested.
4. The optimal time for a solution depends on it's difficulty. I aim for:
  - 15 mins for Easy
  - 30 mins for Medium
  - 60 mins for Hard
5. Think about what the problem domain is: arithmetic, sorting, searching, dynamic programming.
6. Think about what data structures you need: maps, lists, stacks, trees, queues. Does the problem allow you to use them?
7. Don't write any code. Use a paper and pen before entering your solution into the LeetCode IDE.
8. Avoid using standard library searching or sorting. The point of these problems is for you to solve them from "first principals".
9. Validate your solution using the examples given and the ones you have come up with using pen and paper.
  - Are any pointers within the bounds of your data structure?
  - If you are using data structures can you reduce the memory requirements to a constant?
