title: Pay transparency

I was recently inspired after discovering a Slack channel at work for discussing pay.

Folks have posted their current salaries and salaries before and after promotion. There was also a case of a former coworker posting their new salary at a different company after resigning.

This got me thinking of when **#talkpay** was trending on Twitter circa 2018. I distinctly recall a Tweet from a very accomplished developer and being surprised that I was being paid significantly more.

I never posted my salary back then as I'd always viewed revealing one's salary as a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), sort of like playing poker with your hand facing the other players.

In 2017 I was elected by my union local to negotiate a collective agreement with our employer. All salaries were readily available as they are printed in the previous agreement. Given someone's title and tenure, you could calculate any bargaining unit member's salary.

In the private sector, there's no such transparency, and discussing pay has devolved into a strange social taboo that clearly empowers employers.

So with that said I am going to routinely publish my salary, offers, raises, bonuses, stock refreshes, and anything else that might be marginally useful to others with the idea of providing some data on a currently opaque aspect of employment.
